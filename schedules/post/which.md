How comfortable to do feel with the material?
  * 1 - Comfortable (passed at least 2 test)
  * 2 - I struggle, but I kind of get it. (Only missing one or two questions on a test)
  * 3 - I don't understand much of what we've been doing. (Not able to answer any question on test)


```
Write a function that takes in an array as input and returns all the pairs of indices that 
sum to the length of the array.
```
On a scale from 1 to 3, how confident are you that you could implement the above function?
  * 1 - I have a good idea of how this could be done.
  * 2 - I have a sense of how to get started, but I'm not sure if I could finish it.
  * 3 - I don't understand the question/I have no idea where to begin?


```
Write a higher-order function that expects a callback (CB) and an array of numbers (AoN) 
as input. The function should (1) sum all the numbers in AoN, (2) set a timeout that will 
call CB, (passing it the sum) after 5 seconds, and (3) return the sum divided by the length 
of AoN.
