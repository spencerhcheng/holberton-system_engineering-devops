# Tips for Success

We've been teaching this class for a while now, and there are a few habits that we've noticed are used by most of our successful students.

## Treat the course like a bootcamp

The course is hard. Students who think that they can put in anything less than 100% will not reap the full benefit of the course. It's also a very short course, only a month long. So for this month, maybe you don't go out on the weekends and instead study. Maybe you wake up an hour early each day to get some coding in or go to bed an hour later. Every time you are watching TV or surfing the net, you could be learning, growing, and deepining your knowledge as a programmer. This discipline is necessary for your success, and definitely needed to get through a rigorous Bootcmap like App Academy. So treat this prep program as you would the Bootcamp that you want to go to. It'll be tough, but if you give it 100%, you will be astounded by your growth.

## Be patient with yourself

You will not master the material in a week. You will make the same mistakes over and over again. It is ok. Don't beat yourself up, don't use it as an excuse to quit. Keep pushing. For example, when you realize that you are making the same mistake over and over again, use that realization as fuel so you never make that mistake again. Repeat as needed. You will soon find, almost subconsciously, you will stop making the mistake. But you must be rigorous in understanding **why** you made the mistake you made.

You will not become a master programmer overnight. Everything that is worth it in life takes time. Give yourself to time to grow into the developer you want to become.

## Don't get cocky

Some students come in with background skills and are really strong towards the begining of the course. We've seen students like this get cocky and not study the later material and fall behind. DO NOT GET COCKY.

## Be an active learner

What does it mean to be an active learner. It means asking questions when you don't understand. It means striggling through a problem until you get it. It means when you hit a bug, it's not enough to simply solve it; you should understand **why** the bug occurred in the first place. Be active with your learning.

## Fight your fear

Sometimes students don't ask questions because they are afraid of looking dumb. Resist that feeling as best you can. This is your education and your money. Be selfish with your education.  Ask for clarification if you need it.
