# Applying to Bootcamps

First off, congratulations Bootcamp Prep graduate!

Now you're probably asking what are the next steps. Bootcamp Prep guarantees acceptance into at least one bootcamp or your money back. So let's apply!

## Post-Course Study
But wait! Before you start applying, ask yourself how comfortable you feel with the course's material. Bootcamp Prep is fundamentally about using programming to solve problems. The goal is that by the end of the course you have the skills to solve relatively complex problems, have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript and the confidence to explore new topics on your own. 

A good way to gauge if you've met this goal is to try and successfully solve each of the problems presented in the course (on problem sets, assessments, etc.). Do them *without* looking at the solutions. Then do them *timed*. How'd you do?

If you didn't do well and/or are not feeling very confident, then remember, practice makes perfect! **We highly suggest following one of our directed post-course schedules. You can find them [here](../schedules)**! 

As you keep studying, remember:
* Redo problems from class. 
* Find new problems and try them out. 
* Identify what is wrong with your solution. 
* Double check your syntax.
* Style your code.
* Practice talking about what you're doing (your logical approach and your code) aloud. 
* Lastly, **do problems without testing until you are done**. Can you walk through your code as the interpreter correctly? Can you tell if your code will work without running it? This is what applicants who rock their technical interviews are usually able to do. 

## When you're feeling ready...
If you're feeling good, then give yourself a pat on the back. You've worked really hard and have learned a lot. Give yourself credit for that! Then take a look at the list below.

A good strategy is to apply to *every* bootcamp in the city(s) you are considering. Even if you are dead-set on attending one particular coding bootcamp, going through multiple application processes will make for invaluable practice. Each application will force you to practice problem solving using programming, write code in a high-stress and timed environment, talk about your solution and sell yourself as an applicant. Start by applying to bootcamps that you don't care about or with less challenging application processes, and move your way up. Take every coding challenge and technical interview you receive seriously--remember, it's *invaluable practice*. Schedule technical interviews with bootcamps that you care about only when you truly feel ready.

## Scheduling a Mock Interview
For extra practice and to further test to see if you are ready or not, we offer up to *two* mock interviews for each graduate. If you are interested, please schedule yours [here](https://calendly.com/aa-bootcamp/mock)!

Best of luck!
