# Applying to Bootcamps

First off, congratulations Bootcamp Prep graduate!

Now you're probably asking what are the next steps. Bootcamp Prep guarantees acceptance into at least one bootcamp or your money back. So let's apply!

But before you start applying, ask yourself how comfortable you feel with the course's material. Bootcamp Prep is fundamentally about using programming to solve problems. The goal is that by the end of the course you have the skills to solve relatively complex problems, have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript and the confidence to explore new topics on your own. A good way to gauge if you've met this goal is to try and successfully solve each of the problems presented in the course in problem sets and on assessments. Do them without looking at the solutions. Then do them timed. How'd you do?

If you're not feeling very confident, then remember, practice makes perfect! Redo problems introduced during class, and on assessments. Find new problems and try them out. Identify what is wrong with your solution. Double check your syntax. Practice talking about what you're doing (your logical approach and your code) aloud. Do it again!

## When you're feeling ready...
If you're feeling good, then take a look at the list below.

A good strategy is to apply to *every* bootcamp in the city(s) you are considering. Even if you are dead-set on attending one particular coding bootcamp, going through multiple application processes will make for invaluable practice. Each application will force you to practice problem solving using programming, write code in a high-stress and timed environment, talk about your solution and sell yourself as an applicant. Start by applying to bootcamps that you don't care about or with less challenging application processes, and move your way up. Take every coding challenge and technical interview you receive seriously--remember, it's *invaluable practice*. Schedule technical interviews with bootcamps that you care about only when you truly feel ready.

For extra practice and to further test to see if you are ready or not, we offer up to *two* mock interviews for each graduate. Please email us (`wngo@appacademy.io` or `aladson@appacademy.io`) if you are interested in scheduling one.

Lastly, here's a blog [post][haseeb_post] called 'Cracking the Coding Bootcamp â€“ The Definitive Guide' written by an App Academy graduate outlining his process and thoughts about applying to bootcamps which might also be helpful to read.

Best of luck!
