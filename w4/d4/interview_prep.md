## Interview Prep

- **Practice makes perfect!**

  It's always to be over-prepared than under-prepared. If you have an interview scheduled but there's still a concept you're not confident about (eg. loops, high-order functions, etc.), consider rescheduling your interview.

- **Always read the prompt thoroughly and make sure you understand what it's asking for**. If not, clarify your confusion with your interviewer. Even if you think you understand the problem, double check with your interview.

  Do all the examples make sense to you? Can you think of some weird examples? If so, ask the interviewer about them.

- **Prepare a strategy before you start coding**.

 Does your solution require iterating through an array? If so, you probably need a loop. Does your solution require adding things to a data structure that you return at the end? If so, you probably need to initialize the data structure at the beginning of your solution and return it at the end. Are you looking for the max or min? If so, you'll need a placeholder for the current min and max, replacing them only when you encounter something smaller than your min or bigger than your max, respectively. Etc.

- If you're not comfortable talking while you code, that's ok. **Make sure you are able to walk-through and describe your solution in-depth, using the correct language afterwards**.

  However, the best way to learn how to talk about your code correctly is to practice talking about your code. This probably means you'll need to practice talking while you code.

- Don't be afraid to tell your interviewer when you are done. Please let your interviewer know when you are done so he/she can start reviewing your solution with you.

- Just because you said you were done, doesn't mean that you can't correct any mistakes you notice while you are walking through your solution. **Please fix any bugs you find**. Describe to your interviewer why your code is broken and what you are doing to fix it.

- Lastly, be confident. You've worked really hard in Bootcamp Prep and your hard work has paid off. Please do not give up on a problem. **Please always attempt each problem you are given in a technical interview.**
