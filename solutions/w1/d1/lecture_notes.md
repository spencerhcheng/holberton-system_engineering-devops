## The Art of Programming

Programming is the process of developing a set of instructions that automate performing a specific task or solving a specified problem. The instructions are written in a programming language and executed by a computer.

## The Language of Programming

A programming language is a formal, constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a computer. When describing a programming language, we can think about it in two ways: syntactically and semantically. The syntax of a language refers to how its symbols are structured into valid statements and expressions. The semantics of a language refers to the meaning of those symbols. When learning a new language, one of the first steps is to get an understanding of its syntax and semantics.

In this course, we will be using JavaScript, and the first couple of days will be dedicated to learning its its syntax and semantics.

## The Skill of Programming

In order to be a great software engineer, there are certain tangental skills that must be cultivated:

1. Logical Reasoning
2. Numerical Reasoning
3. Procedural Reasoning
4. Curiosity
5. Debugging

One of the primary goals of the course is to provide you with the a foundation and resources to develop these skills.

## The Complexity of Programming

*The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.*

-Edsger Dijkstra

Once you start implementing programs of a sufficient complexity, you will find that it is *very* easy to make mistakes. Unlike computers, the human brain does does always think in perfect logic or arithmetic. The software engineers of the past quickly realized this and started developing techniques and structures to manage the complexity of their programs: variables, good style, abstraction and decomposition, objects and classes. Don't worry if some of those words seem unfamiliar. We will explore them all and more in the course.
