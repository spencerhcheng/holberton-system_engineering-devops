### GENERAL ASSEMBLY
### CODING DOJO  
### GALVANIZE  
### LAUNCH ACADEMY
### HACK REACTOR

### APP ACADEMY  
If you're interested in applying to [App Academy][app_academy], here is the process.

 - **If you haven't applied to a/A before:**

  [Apply][app_academy_app] normally and App Academy will send you an email with a link to prep work and a link to schedule your technical interview.

 - **If you've applied to a/A already:**

  Email App Academy at `contact@appacademy.io` to let us know you're interested in re-applying and we'll send you an email with a link to prep work and a link to schedule you technical interview.

In either scenario, all you have to do is pass the technical interview to be accepted. There will be no coding challenges and no non-technical interview.
