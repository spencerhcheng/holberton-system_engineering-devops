## Taking Assessments
## During an Assessment
When you are ready to take an assessment there are a couple of things you should do:


1. **Download** the zipped assessment through our course page

2. **Unzip** it to get the assessment folder

3. **Rename** the folder to `firstname_lastname_2`. For example, I would rename my second assessment folder `john_doe_2`

4. **Run Mocha** inside the assessment folder to check if it is working. You can use mocha to periodically test whether or not you are passing the assessment (just like cookieMonster!)

6. **Submit** your entire assessment to your designated google drive folder (guide about submitting below)

## After an Assessment

**You will submit assessments and receive assessment feedback through a google drive folder that we will provide.** Talk to your instructor with your name if an invite to this folder.

You will receive an invitation to a google drive folder titled `bpl_firstname_lastname`. Inside this folder you will find numbered subfolders: `assessment_1`, `assessment_2`, etc..

### Submitting Assessments

When you are ready to hand over an assessment, upload it to the appropriate folder. To do this, enter the correct numbered folder, hit **new > folder upload**, select your assessment folder. Be sure to upload the *entire* folder.
+ Name your submission folder: `firstname_lastname_num`
  + For example, I would name my 2nd assessment: `john_doe_2`



### Receiving Feedback
For Monday assessments, after your prep instructor has has read through your assessment submission, you will find a commented version of your assessment folder in that folder. Feel free to download and open in Atom to view.
+ Your feedback will be named: `firstname_lastname_num_feedback`
